# YoloLearning

## Major things done so far:

A small labled dataset of the class "terrorist" from the popular fps game CSGO. These are a set of images and text files that indicate where the object of interest is, in this case the terrorist. This was mostly an experiment in creating my own data using the tool BBOX and then formatting it so that it can be used in YOLO training.

The next step is to gather more data and label it. This will be data with multiple classes (terrorist AND counter-terrorist) and then label all the data. From reading about the ammount of data, it is said that it should be about 300 images per class.

## Timeline:
### Step 1:
Learn how to use AWS 1-2wk
### Step 2:
Install YOLO on AWS and cuda
### Step 3:
scrape screen of 3d game
### Step 4:
Send these images to YOLO/ train yolo
### Step 5 
Send yolo output to another model
### Step 6
profit???
## Conclusion:
hopefully this will be cool
